        <p>Welcome to my fanpage. </p>
        <p>Here you can find some information about my one of my most favorite games: Pokemon Heartgold/Soulsilver</p>

        <p>They were released in 2009 alongside each other (two separate games)</p>
        <p>Although they are remakes of the generation II games Pokemon Gold/Silver and Crystal (which didn't get a remake [SAD]), they are part of generation IV along with Pokemon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum</p>
        <p>They are the second Pokemon remakes, the first being Firered/Leafgreen and the third being White 2/Black 2. Pokemon Gold/Silver were the second games to have remakes, the first being Red/Green and the third being White/Black.</p>
